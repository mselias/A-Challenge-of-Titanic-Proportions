# Data-Science-Theories-And-Methods

This project goes over data science theories and data preprocessing, leveraging the Titanic data set provided by Kaggle, with a goal of determining which passengers will likely survive or perish the monumental tragedy. The binary classification problem was tackled using two methods with three machine learning algorithms respectively. 

The first approach taken was a classical one where the training and testing sets were split manually. The second was to use the split data sets given without any unnecessary manipulations. Applied in both methods respectively, the Logit model (With and without gradient descent), Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.
